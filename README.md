# VBC Data - Spring 2021  
We're back for Spring! 
   

This business simulation involves shortlisting resumes to hire employees
for jobs in a bike factory. Hiring the best employees, as well as paying
them enough and keeping them happy will increase the final score.  
  
Having a program to parse all resumes and eliminate those that 
are inadequate is very helpful in doing what would take a human
an unreasonable amount of time to accomplish. 

This repo will be updated over the duration of the challenge.
