# VBC Data - Spring 2021  
We're back for Spring! 
   

This business simulation involves shortlisting resumes to hire employees
for jobs in a bike factory. Hiring the best employees, as well as paying
them enough and keeping them happy will increase the final score.  
  
Having a program to parse all resumes and eliminate those that 
are inadequate is very helpful in doing what would take a human
an unreasonable amount of time to accomplish.   
  
A huge thanks to the "english-words" repository at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words for providing
the basis file of over 460000 words in [dictionary.txt](dictionary.txt).  

This repo will be updated over the duration of the challenge.
